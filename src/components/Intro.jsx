            After hanging up my snowboard boots for a career change, I completed a Diploma in Web Development and Design to kickstart my learning. I primarily work with front end languages like Javascript and HTML, however I do have some some experience with other languages such as Python, C#, and MySQL, which I got the chance to experience during my studies.</p>
            <p className="text-sm mb-2 font-bold pt-2">In my spare time I love to get out for hikes to take photos, (attempt to) surf, or work on my own personal web projects.</p>
            <p className="text-sm mb-6 font-bold pt-5">I've included some projects I've worked on below and included a contact form to get in touch. I'd love to work with you and your team!</p>
